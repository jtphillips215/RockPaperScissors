# RockPaperScissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

A live preview of the site is located here: https://jtphillips215.github.io/RockPaperScissors/

This project runs a simple game of rock, paper, scissors using vanilla web dev languages. The game was designed to mimic the look and feel of classic gaming consoles from the 80's and hopefully invokes a sense of nostalgia in the player. It was completed as a review before diving back into frameworks. The game makes use of concepts such as DOM manipulation and flexbox, and entirely takes place on the client side. It is intended to be pretty intuitive, and runs on a best of 5 format.

The game runs as follows:
1. The player makes a choice for rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the button.
2. This fires off an event running functions that generate a randomn choice for the computer, testing who won the round, testing if either won the game, and updating the ui accordingly.

This was an enjoyable quick project to complete, and I hope you enjoy playing it.
